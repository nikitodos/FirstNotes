Some papers I've written for the Script Edge community (2016-2018).

Script Edge was a forum based on SMF. I designed it and managed it between 2016 and 2018 for helping people with informatic diseases.

Inside this project, I've been Administrator, Webmaster and, together with my best friend, Chief Technician,

These are the papers (probably out-of-date) that I've written inside the project.

PS. The Astrodynamics Web Platform is based on Script Edge's web interface.
