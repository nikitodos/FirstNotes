# uwave

Some papers I've written for the uWave community (2016-2018).

uWave was a forum based on SMF. I designed it and managed it between 2016 and 2018 for helping people with informatic diseases.

Inside this project, I've been Administrator, Webmaster and, together with my best friend, Chief Technician.

These are the papers (probably out-of-date) that I've written inside the project.
